# üìä Event Study: COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown Impact on Nifty 50 & IT Sector (India)

## üìù Short Description

Event study analysis of the COVID-19 lockdown (March 2020) on India‚Äôs Nifty 50 index and IT sector using a market model. Abnormal returns for IT stocks are not statistically significant during the event window, but cumulative abnormal returns show a significant *positive* impact‚Äîimplying the market anticipated benefits for the IT sector amid the pandemic.

## üß≠ Case Study Summary

This analysis investigates the stock market‚Äôs response to India‚Äôs March 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. Using ¬±10 trading days around the March 24, 2020 lockdown announcement, we compute abnormal returns for the Nifty IT sector index based on a standard market model estimated from the Nifty 50 benchmark.

**Key findings:**
- **Abnormal returns (AR):** No statistically significant effect for IT stocks around the lockdown‚Äîimmediate market impact not detected on a day-by-day basis.
- **Cumulative abnormal returns (CAR):** Show a significant *positive* effect, meaning the IT sector benefitted overall during the event window, likely reflecting digital transformation and increased demand for tech during lockdown.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Methodology Steps:

1. **Data Collection** ‚Äî Download daily Nifty 50 (`^NSEI`) and Nifty IT (`^CNXIT`) prices.
2. **Defining Windows**  
   - **Event Date:** March 24, 2020 (lockdown announced).
   - **Estimation Window:** 60 days before event window.
   - **Event Window:** 10 days before to 10 after (March 10‚ÄìApril 7, 2020).
3. **Return Computation** ‚Äî Convert prices to daily returns.
4. **Market Model Estimation**  
   - Model IT sector returns with market index returns over estimation window.
5. **AR & CAR Calculation**  
   - Calculate abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns in event window.
6. **Statistical Testing**  
   - Use t-tests to determine if AR and CAR differ significantly from zero.
7. **Result Visualization**  
   - Plot AR and CAR over time for intuitive understanding.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Run `Case-studies-ESA_Global-Event.R` script in R.
2. Choose/modifiy event date and estimation/event window parameters as needed.
3. Inspect AR and CAR plots and statistical test outputs in console.

## üìä Interpretation & Conclusion

- The results reveal that while the COVID-19 lockdown was not associated with statistically significant daily abnormal returns for the IT sector, the **cumulative abnormal return (CAR) was both positive and significant**.
- This suggests that the IT sector in India ultimately *benefited* from the digitization trends and operational reliance on technology that were accelerated by the pandemic and lockdown conditions.
